# PhillySafeMap
PhillySafeMap is an Android application that allows users to search crime incidents near a specific location in Philadelphia. The user can sort and filter the crime events by type specified on the application. Philly SafeMap also provides options for emergency contact, resource page and crime search within a user-specified date range.

Problem: Philadelphia is ranked as one of the cities that has the highest crime rate in the world. Specifically around the Drexel campus, crimes such as theft and robbery occur frequently. Majority of the victims are Drexel students who walk home from class at night. We realized this increasing crime rate could affect safety around the campus. Therefore, we want to build the application to help students view all the recent crimes within the area to find the safest way to the destined location.

- Map out crime activity near your current location

Our mobile application is solely developed on android studio. Firebase data service is used for storing user information and crime locations on database.
